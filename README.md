# Super Mayhem Boxes

**Super Mayhem Boxes game mode for gmod (Garry's Mod)**

Originally created by JetBoom for NoXiousNet.com. I updated the code to get it running with current versions of gmod.

In this game mode, you play as boxes in a 2D, physics-based team combat game.

Features (Taken from the original description):

- Two teams in a 2D battleground. Use the weapons and powerups or stomp on their head to defeat other players. Complete the objectives for whatever gametype you're on. Currently there is Capture the Flag and Coin Collector.
- Easy to learn. Just join and play and let the physics do the work.
- Almost everything is physics-based. Use the fan weapon on the flag to make a hot air balloon, stomp on people jumping across a gap to make them fall to their death, and even grapple hook on to a rocket.
- Tons of weaponry and powerups. Lots of physics-based ones like guns that shoot physical bullets, bazookas, grappling hooks, jetpacks, etc.
- Easily create or download new gametypes, weapons, and powerups. Plug and play, drag and drop.
- Tons of top-quality (some old classics too) custom maps are already made.
- Custom entities make it easy to create interactive maps in Hammer. Anything from a on-use door to a flying carpet and rideable Yoshi.
- Old maps are never left in the past when new weapons or powerups come out. Simply use the Tier system to set a powerup to a certain Tier. Any weapon or powerup in that tier will be randomly given to the person picking it up.
- Multiple planes. Movement limitation is mostly handled in Hammer so you can create foregrounds, backgrounds, dungeons, or even crossroads.
- Comes with a stripped version of the NoXiousNet map voting system.

You should be able to find maps around the internet, they are usually named "nox2d_*"
